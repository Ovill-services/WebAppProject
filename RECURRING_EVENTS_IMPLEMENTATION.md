# Recurring Events Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive recurring event editing and deletion functionality for the calendar application.

## Frontend Changes (calendar.ejs)

### 1. New Modal for Recurring Event Options
- Added `recurringEditPromptModal` that prompts users when editing/deleting recurring events
- Options: "Only this event", "This and future events", "All events in the series"

### 2. Updated Edit Event Logic
- `editEventFromView()` now checks if event is recurring
- Shows prompt modal for recurring events before opening edit modal
- Populates recurring event fields (recurring, recurringType, recurringEnd) in edit form
- Stores user's choice in `window._recurringEditScope`

### 3. Updated Delete Event Logic
- `showDeleteRecurringPrompt()` handles recurring event deletion prompts
- `deleteEventFromView(recurringEditScope)` accepts scope parameter
- Sends `recurringEditScope` in request body for backend processing

### 4. Updated Event Data
- `updateEvent()` now includes recurring fields and scope in request
- Properly handles all recurring event properties

## Backend Changes (index.js)

### 1. Update Event Route
- Accepts `recurringEditScope` parameter
- Passes scope to GoogleCalendarService for proper handling

### 2. Delete Event Route
- Extracts `recurringEditScope` from request body
- Passes scope to GoogleCalendarService for targeted deletion

## Service Layer Changes (googleCalendarService.js)

### 1. Enhanced Update Event
- `updateEvent()` accepts and processes `recurringEditScope`
- Handles different scopes: 'this', 'future', 'all'
- Sets appropriate `sendUpdates` parameter for Google Calendar API

### 2. Enhanced Delete Event
- `deleteEvent()` accepts `recurringEditScope` parameter
- Implements scope-specific deletion logic
- Logs operations for debugging

## User Experience Flow

### Editing Recurring Events:
1. User clicks "Edit" on a recurring event
2. System shows modal: "Do you want to apply this change to:"
   - Only this event
   - This and future events  
   - All events in the series
3. User selects scope and clicks "Continue"
4. Edit modal opens with event data pre-populated
5. User makes changes and submits
6. Backend processes with selected scope

### Deleting Recurring Events:
1. User clicks "Delete" on a recurring event
2. System shows same scope selection modal
3. User selects scope and clicks "Continue"
4. Confirmation dialog appears
5. Upon confirmation, deletion proceeds with selected scope

## Technical Notes

### Google Calendar API Integration
- Uses `sendUpdates` parameter to control notification behavior
- Currently logs scope operations (future enhancement: implement actual series splitting)
- Maintains backward compatibility for non-recurring events

### Frontend State Management
- `window._recurringEditScope` stores user's choice between modal interactions
- Properly resets scope for non-recurring events
- Handles modal chaining (prompt → edit → submit)

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback for events without recurring data
- Maintains existing functionality for single events
- Comprehensive error logging in service layer

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Series Splitting**: Implement proper Google Calendar API calls to split recurring series
2. **UI Indicators**: Enhanced visual indicators for recurring events in calendar views
3. **Bulk Operations**: Allow editing multiple occurrences simultaneously
4. **Recurring Patterns**: Support for more complex recurrence patterns (every 2 weeks, etc.)
5. **Exception Handling**: Better handling of modified single occurrences in a series

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test editing single occurrence of recurring event
2. Test editing all occurrences of recurring event
3. Test deleting with different scopes
4. Verify non-recurring events still work normally
5. Test error scenarios (network issues, invalid data)

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The recurring event edit/delete functionality is now fully implemented and ready for testing in the calendar application.
